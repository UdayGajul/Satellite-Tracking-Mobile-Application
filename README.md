# 🛰️ Satellite Tracking Mobile Application

> A mobile app that tracks satellites in real time and displays their position on a 3D Earth model.  
> Provides users with information such as current coordinates and other satellite details.

**_⭐ This project was completed as my Master’s final year research project with my classmates in a team effort. I selected the topic of satellite tracking, performed research and a literature review, identified a real‑world problem, worked on implementing the Three.js 3D Earth model and handling complex TLE data, and integrated API and React Native components. The final result is this mobile application, developed as a practical solution to the identified problem._**

## 📌 Features

1. 👤 User registration and login so only authenticated users can use the app  
2. 🧭 Simple 3D Earth model visible when the app launches  
3. 💫 Users can choose orbit categories (LEO, MEO, GEO) using the app’s navigation drawer to view satellites in the selected orbit  
4. 🌐 Only top satellites from selected countries (India, Russia, China, USA, UK) are available  
5. 🛰️ Live tracking where satellites move on the Earth model in real time  
6. 📊 Basic satellite information such as coordinates, altitude and other details  
7. ❓ FAQ section on satellite

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React Native for building the mobile app using JavaScript and native UI components.  
**Backend & Database:** PHP running on XAMPP (Apache + MySQL) to handle server logic and database interactions.  
**API Testing & Development:** Postman for creating, testing, and debugging the app’s API endpoints.  
**3D Earth Visualization:** Three.js for rendering the interactive 3D Earth model and satellite paths.  
**Satellite Orbit Data:** Uses TLE data from CelesTrak to calculate and show satellite positions.
